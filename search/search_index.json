Supports unification of sites with the same site_name into a single sub-site. Note: Since version 0.6 MkDocs Merge added support for MkDocs 1.0 and dropped support for earlier versions. See here for more details about the changes in MkDocs 1.0 . MkDocs-Merge supports Python versions 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6 and pypy. Install $ pip install mkdocs-merge Usage $ mkdocs-merge run MASTER_SITE SITES [-u]... Parameters MASTER_SITE : the path to the MkDocs site where the base mkdocs.yml file resides. This is where all other sites will be merged into. SITES : the paths to each of the MkDocs sites that will be merged. Each of these paths is expected to have a mkdocs.yml file and a docs folder. -u (optional): Unify sites with the same \"site_name\" into a single sub-site. Example $ mkdocs-merge run root/mypath/mysite /another/path/new-site /newpath/website A single MkDocs site will be created in root/mypath/mysite , and the sites in /another/path/new-site and /newpath/website will be added as sub-pages.

Check this StackOverflow answer for more details about the dev dependencies $ pip install -e .[dev] Test The tests can be run using tox from the root directory. tox is part of the development dependencies: $ tox Project Status Very basic implementation.
